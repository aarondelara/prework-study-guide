# Aaron DeLara's Prework Study Guide

## Description

A notebook is needed for notes but what happens if you're traveling and you want to study your notes but you forgot to bring your notebook? That situation is exactly why I wanted to create this website, I needed to be able to access my notes whenever I want in the world as long as I have a connection to the internet. This helps a lot with studying at work and I'm on break. I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
